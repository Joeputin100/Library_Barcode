  Test files available for debugging:
  1. copy_of_working.mrc - Exact copy of your working file
  (baseline test)
  2. minimal_020_test.mrc - Simple 020 field with just $a
  subfield
  3. test_020_only.mrc - 020 field with all subfields ($a,
  $c, $z, $q)
  4. careful_020_test.mrc - Extremely careful format
  matching

  To resume testing:
  1. Import copy_of_working.mrc first to confirm basic
  functionality works
  2. Then test minimal_020_test.mrc to see if simple 020
  field works
  3. Finally test test_020_only.mrc to identify which
  additional subfields cause issues
