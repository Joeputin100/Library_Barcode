    "overall_goal": "To process book data, extract metadata from LOC, Google Books, and Vertex AI APIs, and generate barcode and QR code labels.",
    "key_knowledge": [
        "The project is `barcode` and is focused on processing book data.",
        "It uses LOC API, Google Books API, and Vertex AI for metadata extraction.",
        "The `streamlit_app.py` script is the main application.",
        "The `get_book_metadata_google_books` function now extracts `mainCategory` and `seriesInfo`.",
        "A `google_category_to_dewey_map` has been created for estimating DDNs from Google Books categories.",
        "The `clean_call_number` function now incorporates this Google Books DDN estimation as a fallback.",
        "Vertex AI is used as a final fallback for classification.",
        "The `streamlit_app.py` has been modified to display debug logs within an `st.expander` and provide a download button for full logs.",
        "Identified issues: Missing Series Title/Number, 'No genre' from Google Books, and ignored Vertex AI responses.",
        "The `query_parser.py` has been extended to handle individual barcodes, barcode ranges, barcodes starting with a prefix, and field-specific queries (author, title, series, ISBN, call number, holding barcode).",
        "The `marc_processor.py` module has been created to load and filter MARC records based on parsed queries. It correctly extracts holding barcodes from MARC tag 852 subfield 'p'.",
        "The TUI functionality has been separated into two distinct applications:",
        "  - `project_viewer.py`: A TUI for viewing project status (plan, state, context).",
        "  - `marc_query_tui.py`: A TUI for querying MARC records, including query confirmation and full result display.",
        "The `streamlit_app.py` has been refactored into smaller modules: `api_calls.py`, `caching.py`, `csv_importer.py`, `data_cleaning.py`, and `pdf_generation.py`.",
        "The natural language query parser has been significantly improved to handle complex queries, including 'and' conditions and various barcode formats (numeric, alphanumeric, padded zeros).",
        "The `marc_processor.py` has been updated to correctly handle barcode normalization for comparison, including padded zeros.",
        "The `marc_query_tui.py` now includes a help screen with query syntax and examples.",
        "All tests for the TUI are currently passing, ensuring robustness of the parser and UI interactions.",
        "Atriuum supports updating existing MARC records via import using 'overlay' options, matching by Custom Control Number, ISBN/UPC, Title, or Title and Author."
