Fixed fundamental API title/author extraction. Added all MARC field columns to database. Identified need for Mangle rule improvements: Google Books provides publisher, physical description, and other MARC fields that aren't being extracted. Record #22 partially improved: now has publication date (2020), subjects (Computers), genre (Computers), language (en). Publisher and physical description still missing due to Mangle rule limitations."}
